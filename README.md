# Legacy-CH340-Driver-Tested-Work-With-ESP8266
Legacy CH340 driver tested working with ESP8266 (On my computer newer versions would make COM communication with 8266 broken)

If your ESP8266 can't be programmed by PlatformIO/Arduino IDEs, and kept giving errors like "Cannot configure port, something went wrong". You can try this old version driver which finally solved my problem.
